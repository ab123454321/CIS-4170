# Movie Box Office Storytelling with Data Presentation

## Overview

This repository hosts a Python Jupyter Notebook developed for the course **CIS 4170** with **Professor Anna O'Connell**. The notebook 
demonstrates data manipulation and visualization techniques using a dataset of the top 1000 highest-grossing movies.

- **Created**: 02/27/22
- **Author**: Alexander Batch

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes various details about the top 1000 
highest-grossing movies. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sanjeetsinghnaik/top-1000-highest-grossing-movies/version/1).

## Features
The notebook includes the following features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Calculation of ratios such as the Domestic vs International Sales Ratio.
- Addition of new fields such as year, month, day, and day of the week extracted from the release date.
- Visualization of data using scatter plots and bar charts to explore correlations and distributions.

## Libraries Used
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## Installation
To run this notebook:
1. Ensure that Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
3. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to view and execute the code.

## Usage
The notebook is divided into sections with markdown explanations and corresponding code cells. Each section can be 
executed independently, provided the initial data loading and cleaning steps have been completed.
